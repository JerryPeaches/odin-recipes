        <h2>Kody's Strongman Pizza</h2>
            <p>High protein pizza made with two-ingredient dough, shredded chicken and your favorite delicious pizza toppings.</p>
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
                        <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
                        <li>1.5 cup shredded chicken breast</li>
                        <li>3/4 cup pizza sauce</li>
                        <li>1 cup mozzarella cheese</li>
                        <li>1/4 bell pepper, <em>sliced</em></li>
                        <li>1/4 red onion, <em>sliced</em></li>
                        <li>10-12 slices turkey pepperoni</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.</li>
                        <li>In a medium bowl, add Greek yogurt or cottage cheese and self-rising flour. Mix with a spoon and then finish with clean hands, forming into a round ball of dough. Note: it will be a little bit sticky! If it gets too sticky, rinse your hands and lightly coat your hands with flour before continuing to work on the dough.</li>
                        <li>Next, roll out the dough on a piece of parchment paper using a lightly floured rolling pin. The dough should be quite thin but still durable. You can also use any floured cylinder shape to roll the dough, like a cup (use something non-breakable, like a plastic tumbler). Since the dough is a bit sticky, I recommend doing this directly on the parchment paper that you'll be baking on. You can roll out the dough on a floured surface too, but it may stick a bit. You can also use a silicone baking mat.</li>
                        <li>Next, spread your pizza sauce evenly on the rolled out pizza dough.</li>
                        <li>Add the shredded chicken first, and then top with shredded cheese, pepperoni and veggies.</li>
                        <li>Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes until cheese is melted and the crust is golden brown. Note: If you like less sauce and less toppings, it will be done closer to 20 minutes. If you have more sauce and more toppings, it will likely take a few minutes longer.</li>
